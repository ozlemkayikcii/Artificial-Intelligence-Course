If you haven't studied mutability, don't worry: This just means that any given `ConnectFourBoard` instance, including the locations of the pieces on it, will never change after it's created. To make a move on a board, you (or, rather, the support code that we provide for you) create a new `ConnectFourBoard` object with your new token in its correct position. This makes it much easier to make a search tree of boards: You can take your initial board and try several different moves from it without modifying it, before deciding what you actually want to do. The provided `minimax` search takes advantage of this; see the `get_all_next_moves`, `minimax`, and `minimax_find_board_value` functions in `basicplayer.py`.\n","\n","So, to make a move on a board, you could do the following:\n","\n","`>>> myBoard = ConnectFourBoard()`<BR>\n","`>>> myBoard`\n","<PRE>\n","  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 \n","0 \n","1 \n","2\n","3\n","4\n","5\n","</PRE> \n","\n","\n","`>>> myNextBoard = myBoard.do_move(1)`<BR>\n","`>>> myNextBoard`\n","\n","<PRE>\n","  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 \n","0 \n","1 \n","2 \n","3 \n","4 \n","5   X\n","</PRE> \n","\n","\n","`>>> myBoard # Just to show that the original board hasn't changed`\n","\n","<PRE>\n","  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 \n","0 \n","1 \n","2\n","3\n","4\n","5\n","</PRE>\n","\n","There are quite a few methods on the `ConnectFourBoard` object.

The new board will indicate that it's now the other player's turn.\n","* `longest_chain(playerid)` -- Returns the length of the longest contiguous chain of tokens held by the player with the specified player ID.
