        "During Obama's visit to MIT, you got a chance to impress him with your analytical thinking. Now, he has hired you to do some political modeling for him. He seems to surround himself with smart people that way.\n",
        "\n",
        "He takes a moment out of his busy day to explain what you need to do. \"I need a better way to tell which of my plans are going to be supported by Congress,\" he explains. \"Do you think we can get a model of Democrats and Republicans in Congress, and which votes separate them the most?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes, we can!\" You answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Data\n",
        "\n",
        "You acquire the data on how everyone in the previous Senate and House of Representatives voted on every issue. (These data are available in machine-readable form via voteview.com. We've included it in the laboratory directory, in the files beginning with `H110` and `S110`.)\n",
        "\n",
        "The Data Reader code contains functions for reading data in this format.\n",
        "\n",
        "`read_congress_data(\"FILENAME.ord\")` reads a specially-formatted file that gives information about each Congressperson and the votes they cast. It returns a list of dictionaries, one for each member of Congress, including the following items:\n",
        "* 'name': The name of the Congressperson.\n",
        "* 'state': The state they represent.\n",
        "* 'party': The party that they were elected under.\n",
        "* 'votes': The votes that they cast, as a list of numbers. 1 represents a \"yea\" vote, -1 represents \"nay\", and 0 represents either that they abstained, were absent, or were not a member of Congress at the time.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make sense of the votes, you will also need information about what they were voting on. This is provided by `read_vote_data(\"FILENAME.csv\")`, which returns a list of votes in the same order that they appear in the Congresspeople's entries. Each vote is represented a dictionary of information, which you can convert into a readable string by running `vote_info(vote)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Data Reader code reads in the provided data, storing them in the variables `senate_people`, `senate_votes`, `house_people`, and `house_votes`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Nearest Neighbors\n",
        "\n",
        "You decide to start by making a nearest-neighbors classifier that can tell Democrats apart from Republicans in the Senate.\n",
        "\n",
        "We've provided a `nearest_neighbors` function that classifies data based on training data and a distance function. In particular, this is a third-order function:\n",
        "* First, call `nearest_neighbors(distance, k)`, with distance being the distance function you wish to use and `k` being the number of neighbors to check. This returns a *classifier factory*.\n",
        "* A classifier factory is a function that makes classifiers. You call it with some training data as an argument, and it returns a classifier.\n",
        "* Finally, you call the classifier with a data point (here, a Congressperson) and it returns the classification as a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "Much of this is handled by the `evaluate(factory, group1, group2)` function, which you can use to test the effectiveness of a classification strategy. You give it a classifier factory (as defined above) and two sets of data. It will train a classifier on one data set and test the results against the other, and then it will switch them and test again.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a list of data such as `senate_people`, you can divide it arbitrarily into two groups using the `crosscheck_groups(data)` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "One way to measure the \"distance\" between Congresspeople is with the *Hamming distance*: the number of entries that differ. This function is provided as `hamming_distance`.\n",
        "\n",
        "An example of putting this all together is provided in the laboratory code:\n",
        "\n",
        "    senate_group1, senate_group2 = crosscheck_groups(senate_people)\n",
        "    evaluate(nearest_neighbors(edit_distance, 1), senate_group1, senate_group2, verbose=1)\n",
        "Examine the results of this evaluation. In addition to the problems caused by independents, it's classifying Senator Johnson from South Dakota as a Republican instead of a Democrat, mainly because he missed a lot of votes while he was being treated for cancer. This is a problem with the distance function -- when one Senator votes yes and another is absent, that is less of a \"disagreement\" than when one votes yes and the other votes no.\n",
        "\n",
        "You should address this. Euclidean distance is a reasonable measure for the distance between lists of discrete numeric features, and is the alternative to Hamming distance that you decide to try. Recall that the formula for Euclidean distance is:\n",
        "\n",
        "*[(x1 - y1)^2 + (x2 - y2)^2 + ... + (xn - yn)^2] ^ (1/2)*\n",
        "* Make a distance function called euclidean_distance that treats the votes as high-dimensional vectors, and returns the Euclidean distance between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you evaluate using `euclidean_distance`, you should get better results, except that some people are being classified as Independents. Given that there are only 2 Independents in the Senate, you want to avoid classifying someone as an Independent just because they vote similarly to one of them.\n",
        "* Make a simple change to the parameters of `nearest_neighbors` that accomplishes this, and call the classifier factory it outputs `my_classifier`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## ID Trees\n",
        "\n",
        "So far you've classified Democrats and Republicans, but you haven't created a model of which votes distinguish them. You want to make a classifier that explains the distinctions it makes, so you decide to use an ID-tree classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "`idtree_maker(votes, disorder_metric)` is a third-order function similar to `nearest_neighbors`. You initialize it by giving it a list of vote information (such as `senate_votes` or `house_votes`) and a function for calculating the disorder of two classes. It returns a classifier factory that will produce instances of the `CongressIDTree` class, defined in the Classify code, to distinguish legislators based on their votes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The possible decision boundaries used by `CongressIDTree` are, for each vote:\n",
        "* Did this legislator vote YES on this vote, or not?\n",
        "* Did this legislator vote NO on this vote, or not?\n",
        "\n",
        "(These are different because it is possible for a legislator to abstain or be absent.)\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also use `CongressIDTree` directly to make an ID tree over the entire data set.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you `print` a `CongressIDTree`, then you get a text representation of the tree. Each level of the ID tree shows the minimum disorder it found, the criterion that gives this minimum disorder, and (marked with a +) the decision it makes for legislators who match the criterion, and (marked with a -) the decision for legislators who don't. The decisions are either a party name or another ID tree. An example is shown in the section below.\n",
        "\n",
        "## An ID tree for the entire Senate\n",
        "\n",
        "You start by making an ID tree for the entire Senate. This doesn't leave you anything to test it on, but it will show you the votes that distinguish Republicans from Democrats the most quickly overall. You run this (which you can uncomment in your lab file):\n",

What about 95? **To pass the tests**, you will need to find close to the minimum such values for *N_1*, *N_2*, and *N_3*. Keep guessing to find close to the minimum that will pass the offline tests. Do the values surprise you? Is the house more unpredictable than the senate, or is it just bigger?\n",
